Predicting Nurse Stress Levels Using Wearable Sensor Data

The project aims to explore the feasibility of using a wearable watch with multiple sensors to detect and forecast stress levels. Data was collected from nurses wearing the watch and reporting stress levels. The project involves data exploration, cleaning, and pre-processing to identify potential signals for predicting stress. The goal is to identify signals for stress prediction and develop a modelling approach with high recall, using the training data to train the model and the test data to evaluate its prediction accuracy.
